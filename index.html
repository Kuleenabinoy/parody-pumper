                    Once upon a time not so long ago
                    Tommy used to work on the docks, union's been on strike
                    He's down on his luck, it's tough, so tough
                    Gina works the diner all day working for her man
                    She brings home her pay, for love, for love
                    She says, we've got to hold on to what we've got
                    It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
                    We've got each other and that's a lot for love
                    We'll give it a shot
                    Woah, we're half way there
                    Woah, livin' on a prayer
                    Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
                    Woah, livin' on a prayer
                    Tommy's got his six-string in hock
                    Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk
                    So tough, it's tough
                    Gina dreams of running away
                    When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
                    Baby, it's okay, someday
                    We've got to hold on to what we've got
                    It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
                    We've got each other and that's a lot for love
                    We'll give it a shot
                    Woah, we're half way there
                    Woah, livin' on a prayer
                    Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
                    Woah, livin' on a prayer
                    Livin' on a prayer
                    Oh, we've got to hold on, ready or not
                    You live for the fight when it's all that you've got
                    Woah, we're half way there
                    Woah, livin' on a prayer
                    Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
                    Woah, livin' on a prayer
                    Woah, we're half way there
                    Woah, livin' on a prayer
                    Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
                    Woah, livin' on a prayer
                    Woah, we're half way there
                    Woah, livin' on a prayer
                    Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
                    Woah, livin' on a prayer
